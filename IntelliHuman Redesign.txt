1) Project Goal
Design a premium, enterprise-grade website for IntelliHuman that communicates:
1. What we do (insurance decisioning AI for claims + underwriting + fraud)

2. Why we’re different (ontology + 8-layer knowledge system + explainability)

3. Why we’re safe to buy (auditability, governance, security, integrations)

4. What to do next (Request Demo)

Primary conversion: Request Demo
